# Bermuda Development Guide

## Environment Requirements

- **Python 3.13** is required (not 3.11 or 3.12)
- **Home Assistant 2025.10+** or later (2026.x recommended)
- Development happens in a Dev Container - respect `.vscode/settings.json`

## Quick Setup

```bash
# Create virtual environment with Python 3.13
python3.13 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install ALL dependencies (order matters for some packages like PyRIC)
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
pip install -r requirements_test.txt
```

## Local Validation (Run Before EVERY Commit)

```bash
# 1. Linting and formatting (MUST pass)
python -m ruff check --fix
python -m ruff format

# 2. Type checking - strict mode (MUST pass)
python -m mypy --strict --install-types --non-interactive

# 3. Tests (MUST pass)
python -m pytest --cov -q
```

## Critical: Type-Checking & Dependency Discipline

- Do **NOT** suppress `import-not-found` or `import-untyped` errors
- Do **NOT** weaken `mypy.ini` or add blanket `# type: ignore` markers
- When mypy reports missing stubs (e.g., `Library stubs not installed for "aiofiles"`):
  → Add the matching `types-*` package to `requirements_dev.txt`
- When mypy reports `import-not-found` for a library:
  → Ensure package is in `requirements_test.txt` or `requirements.txt`
  → Assume environment is incomplete before assuming code is wrong

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components

| Component | File | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| **Coordinator** | `coordinator.py` | Drives Bluetooth processing, subscribes to HA Bluetooth manager, tracks scanners, prunes stale devices |
| **BermudaDevice** | `bermuda_device.py` | Represents each Bluetooth address, normalizes MACs, classifies address types, caches area/floor metadata |
| **Metadevices** | - | Group rotating identities (IRK, iBeacon) so changing MACs map to stable logical devices |
| **Entities** | `sensor.py`, `device_tracker.py`, etc. | Read state from coordinator |

### Area Selection System

The area selection logic in `coordinator.py` (`_refresh_area_by_min_distance`) determines which room a device is in:

1. **Distance contender check**: Adverts must have valid distance within max_radius
2. **Stability margin**: Challenger must be significantly closer (8% or 0.2m) to compete
3. **Streak requirement**: Multiple consecutive wins needed (4 same-floor, 6 cross-floor)
4. **Cross-floor protection**: Stricter requirements for floor changes
5. **Absolute profile rescue**: When primary scanner offline, secondary patterns can protect area

### Scanner Correlation Learning (`correlation/`)

Learns typical RSSI patterns for each area to improve localization:

| Class | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `ScannerPairCorrelation` | Tracks RSSI delta between primary and secondary scanners |
| `ScannerAbsoluteRssi` | Tracks absolute RSSI from each scanner (for offline fallback) |
| `AreaProfile` | Collection of correlations for one area |
| `CorrelationStore` | Persistence to Home Assistant storage |

**Key insight**: When primary scanner goes offline, absolute profiles let us verify if secondary scanner readings still match the learned room pattern.

## Testing Standards

### Running Tests

```bash
# Full test suite
python -m pytest tests/ --cov -q

# Single test file
python -m pytest tests/test_coordinator_hardening.py -v

# Single test
python -m pytest tests/test_area_selection.py::test_specific_function -v
```

### Test Fixture Requirements

When creating coordinator mocks, these attributes are required:

```python
coordinator = BermudaDataUpdateCoordinator.__new__(BermudaDataUpdateCoordinator)
coordinator.options = {CONF_MAX_RADIUS: 10.0}
coordinator.correlations = {}  # Scanner correlation data
coordinator._correlations_loaded = True  # Prevent async loading
coordinator._last_correlation_save = 0.0  # Last save timestamp
coordinator.correlation_store = MagicMock(async_save=AsyncMock())  # Mock store
coordinator.AreaTests = BermudaDataUpdateCoordinator.AreaTests
```

For FakeAdvert classes in tests:
```python
self.scanner_address = scanner_device.address if scanner_device else None
```

For FakeDevice classes:
```python
self.address = f"AA:BB:CC:..."  # Must have an address attribute
```

## Code Style & Clean Coding

### Logging (ruff G004)
```python
# GOOD - lazy formatting
_LOGGER.debug("Processing device %s at distance %.2f", device.name, distance)

# BAD - eager formatting (fails ruff G004)
_LOGGER.debug(f"Processing device {device.name} at distance {distance:.2f}")
```

### Exceptions
```python
# GOOD - precise type, chained
raise ValueError("Invalid distance") from original_error

# BAD - broad except, no chaining
except Exception:
    pass
```

### Async Discipline
- Keep code non-blocking
- Use `asyncio.to_thread` for blocking operations
- Handle `CancelledError` properly
- Use `asyncio.TaskGroup` when appropriate

### Security
- No `eval`/`exec`
- Avoid `shell=True`
- Prefer `yaml.safe_load`
- Redact secrets/PII in logs

## Home Assistant Integration Notes

- Keep `manifest.json` aligned with HA guidance
- Store config entry state on `entry.runtime_data` with typed structures
- Inject shared session via `async_get_clientsession(hass)`
- Store tokens/state via `helpers.storage.Store` with throttled writes
- Provide repairs/diagnostics with redaction

## Key Constants (`const.py`)

| Constant | Value | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| `SAME_FLOOR_STREAK` | 4 | Consecutive wins for same-floor switch |
| `CROSS_FLOOR_STREAK` | 6 | Consecutive wins for cross-floor switch |
| `INCUMBENT_MARGIN_PERCENT` | 0.08 | 8% closer required to challenge |
| `INCUMBENT_MARGIN_METERS` | 0.20 | OR 0.2m closer required |
| `CROSS_FLOOR_MIN_HISTORY` | 8 | Min history for cross-floor historical checks |

## Recent Changes (Session Notes)

### Room Flickering Fix
- **Problem**: Tracker constantly switched rooms despite being stationary
- **Solution**: Added stability margin requiring challengers to be significantly closer
- **Files**: `const.py`, `coordinator.py`

### Scanner Outage Resilience
- **Problem**: When primary scanner went offline, room switched incorrectly
- **Solution**: Absolute RSSI profile learning - secondary scanner patterns protect area
- **Files**: `correlation/scanner_absolute.py`, `correlation/area_profile.py`, `coordinator.py`

### Test Fixture Updates
- Added `correlations`, `_correlations_loaded`, `_last_correlation_save`, `correlation_store` to coordinator mocks
- Added `scanner_address` to FakeAdvert, `address` to FakeDevice
